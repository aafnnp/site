打开终端，输入以下命令：

```shell
docker run hello-world

# Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
# latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
# 0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
# Digest: sha256:4cf9c47f86df71d48364001ede3a4fcd85ae80ce02ebad74156906caff5378bc
# Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
#
# Hello from Docker!
# This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
#
# To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
#  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
#  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
#     (amd64)
#  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
#     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
#  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
#     to your terminal.
#
# To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
#  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
#
# Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
#  https://hub.docker.com/
#
# For more examples and ideas, visit:
#  https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

hello-world 是一个测试镜像，它会在终端输出一段文字，说明 docker 安装成功。

现在在终端输入以下命令：

```shell
docker ps -a
# CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
# 128ec8ceab71        hello-world         "/hello"            14 seconds ago      Exited (0) 13 seconds ago                      exciting_chebyshev
```

可以看到，docker 会自动创建一个容器，容器名为 exciting_chebyshev，容器 ID 为 128ec8ceab71。
