## Introduction to Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It was first released in May 2017 and has since gained popularity due to its ability to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

Flutter is used by developers and organizations around the world, and it's growing in popularity for a variety of reasons:

- Cross-platform development: Flutter allows you to build apps for Android, iOS, web, and desktop using the same codebase. This can significantly reduce development time and costs.
- Hot Reload: This feature allows developers to see the effects of their changes almost instantly without losing the current application state. It boosts productivity and makes debugging faster and easier.
- Customizable and extensible: Flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets that are customizable and extensible. It also allows you to create your own widgets.

## Installation and Setup

To start developing with Flutter, you need to set up your development environment. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. System requirements: Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating Systems: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit), x86-64 based Linux distribution, or macOS (64-bit).
- Disk Space: 1.64 GB on Windows, 600MB on Linux/Mac.
- Tools: Windows PowerShell 5.0 or newer or Git for Windows 2.16.2 or newer.

2. Download Flutter SDK: Visit the Flutter website and download the stable version of the Flutter SDK.

3. Extract the file: Extract the zipped file in an appropriate location on your machine.

4. Update your path: To run Flutter commands in the console, update your system path to include the Flutter bin directory.

5. Install an IDE: You can use any text editor combined with command-line tools, but IDEs like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code are recommended as they provide integrated tools for Flutter development.

6. Install Flutter and Dart plugins: If you're using Android Studio or Visual Studio Code, install the Flutter and Dart plugins. These plugins provide a suite of tools for working with Flutter, including hot reload and widget editing.

7. Set up an emulator: To test your Flutter apps, you'll need a mobile device emulator. This can be set up through your chosen IDE.

Congratulations! You've now set up your Flutter development environment. In the next unit, we'll dive into Dart, the programming language used in Flutter.
